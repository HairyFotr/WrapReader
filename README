A reader and graphic display of the data from the Vuzix Wrap 920AR tracker.

Usage:
    For reading and graphing from the tracker (or a direct dump):
        ./run <filename>
    This also creates .txt and .png data in the graphs folder.
    If no <filename> is given, it reads from /dev/hidraw0.
    
    Graphs of .txt data can be replayed with:
        python Graph.py < graphs/<filename>.txt
    and .png images recreated with:
        python Graph.py -png < graphs/<filename>.txt

Requirements:
    gcc
    python
    python-pygame
    scrot
